## Keynote: When Everyone Can Code, What’s a Quant Still For?

**Date & Time:** February 18 at 8:00am, Eastern

### Abstract

Quant risk is in a weird new place: code is no longer the bottleneck. When LLMs make it easy for basically anyone to produce working R or Python code, the question stops being “can we build it?” and becomes “can we trust it, explain it, and reproduce it?”

In this keynote I’ll argue that what matters most now is system architecture, validation, and ownership, and all three get harder (and more important) when building gets cheap. Architecture isn’t just “tech design,” it’s policy: it nudges humans and LLMs to write code that’s modular, reviewable, and easy for someone else to verify. Validation has to level up too. LLM-assisted workflows are great at producing something that looks right very quickly.  However, testing can’t be the cleanup step at the end. We need strong automated tests, input/data checks, and backtesting that’s built into the way work ships.

But it’s not only about tests. It’s also about reproducibility: pinned environments, versioned data, and the ability to rerun a result and get the same answer—because if you can’t reproduce it, you can’t audit it, and you can’t own it. And as more people can push code, governance has to scale: clear code ownership, review gates, protected pipelines, and sensible guardrails that keep velocity high without turning production into a free-for-all. This is where the research/production line matters: experiments should be easy and encouraged; production should be boring, controlled, and observable.

Finally, we need a culture shift. The computer isn’t responsible for your results. The IDE didn’t do it. The model didn’t do it. We did. In an “everyone can code” world, excellence looks less like personal wizardry and more like systems thinking: designing workflows where the right thing is the easy thing, and where accountability is clear when things go wrong. The goal isn’t to slow down. The goal is to make speed safe.

## The Distributions Tailored to Skewed and Fat Tails in the FatTailsR Package

**Date & Time:** February 18 at 9:55am, Eastern

### Abstract

The FatTailsR package [1], available on CRAN since 2014 and listed in the Distributions task view [2], introduces a new family of distributions on top of the logistic distribution built with 3 or 4 parameters for left and right fat tails. We give the design pattern of these distributions:

- The version with 3 parameters (mu, gamma, kappa) is for symmetrical distributions and has closed forms for the pdf, cdf, quantile function and Radon-Nikodym derivate. Mu is the median, gamma is a scale parameter related to the density at the median, kappa is the shape and tail parameter. Kappa is exactly the Pareto exponent which means the various moments fall exactly at defined values of kappa: the kurtosis falls when kappa <= 4, the variance when kappa <= 2, the mean when kappa <= 1. It is possible to build distributions with kappa <= 1 and tails much thicker than the Cauchy distribution. When kappa tends to Infinity, the distribution tends to the 2-parameter logistic distribution.
- Several representations with 4 parameters are possible to describe skewed distributions. In addition to mu and gamma, we can use alpha and omega as the Pareto exponents of the left and right fat tails. We can also use kappa and delta where delta is the distortion of the distribution and by design its absolute value is always lower than kappa. We can also use kappa and epsilon where epsilon = delta/kappa is an eccentricity between -1 and +1 and is convenient for parameter estimation.

For all these 3 and 4 parameters versions, the quantile function, the Radon-Nikodym derivative, the moments, the Value-at-Risk and the Expected Shortfall have explicit forms unlike stable distributions.

- Designing a stochastic process is easy. It is possible to design processes with a zero mean, a non-null median and a tail thicker than the other one.
- Several approaches are possible for the parameter estimation. A very interesting feature is that both the central part and the tails are estimated in one step, and accurately. The non-parametric approach is blazing fast. One parametric approach uses the logit of the empirical distribution.
- Fitting such distributions, whether by MLE or any other techniques, provides a reliable estimate of the tail index on both sides, comparable to, or even better than the Hill estimator.
- We have been using extensively these distributions in finance to estimate the distributions of asset returns on various periods, and use the corresponding VaR and ES to assess the underlying financial risk and to build optimized portfolios.
- Examples and videos over rolling windows picked in [3] will be presented during the talk.

## Financial Dependence via ISE100 via vine copulas: R packages for risk modeling

**Date & Time:** February 18 at 10:40am, Eastern

### Abstract

This study aims to investigate a Regular-Vine copula approach to estimate the interdependence structure of the Istanbul Stock Exchange index (ISE100). For this purpose, we consider 32 stocks related to 6 sectors belonging to ISE100.

To reflect the time-varying impacts of the 2008–2009 global financial crisis, the dependence analysis is conducted over pre-, during-, and post-global financial crisis periods. Portfolio analysis is considered via a rolling window approach to capture the changes in the dependence.

We compare the Regular-Vine-based generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) against the conventional GARCH model with different innovations. Value at risk and expected shortfall risk measures are used to validate the models.

Additionally, for the constructed portfolios, return performance is summarized using both Sharpe and Sortino ratios. To test the ability of the considered Regular-Vine approach on ISE100, another evaluation has been done during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis with various parameter settings.

While presenting the case study results, some R programming details will be highlighted.

## Identifying Critical Participants in the SIC Payment System with R

**Date & Time:** February 18 at 12:10pm, Eastern

### Abstract

As digital and instant payments spread, the resilience of central payment systems is increasingly important. We adapt a network‑and‑clustering framework to identify participants whose failure could disrupt system continuity, adding to the standard framework of Glowka et al. (2025) three practical dimensions — payment type (interbank vs customer), intrayear frequency, and transaction view (value vs volume) — and weighting scenario outcomes by economic activity to prioritise operational relevance. Applied to SIC (Switzerland’s central payment system), the method highlights critical roles played by mid‑sized domestic banks and, at times, financial‑market infrastructures alongside the consistently critical large international banks; volume‑based views shift prominence for some participants. Results are robust and useful for realistic stress tests and regulatory assessment.

The full reproducible workflow is implemented in R and will be shown step‑by‑step: data ingestion and wrangling (tidyverse, DBI, odbc, dbplyr), network and clustering analysis with parallelisation (tidygraph, tidymodels, tidyclust, furrr), and communication (ggplot2, patchwork, gt). Attendees will see code patterns, performance tips and visualisation techniques they can apply to their transaction or network datasets — no prior payments expertise required.

### Bios

## Agentic R Workflows for High-Stakes Risk Analysis

**Date & Time:** February 18 at 12:55pm, Eastern

### Abstract

Agentic R coding enables autonomous workflows that help analysts build, test, and refine risk models while keeping every step transparent and reproducible. This talk shows how R agents can construct end-to-end risk analysis pipelines, explore uncertainty through simulation and stress testing, and generate interpretable outputs tied directly to executable R code. Rather than replacing analysts, agentic workflows accelerate iteration, surface hidden assumptions, and improve model robustness. Attendees will learn practical patterns for using agentic R coding responsibly in high-stakes risk analysis.

## A Bayesian R Framework for Quantifying Cyber Risk Using the FAIR Model and MITRE ATT\&CK

**Date & Time:** February 18 at 2:25pm, Eastern

### Abstract

Quantifying cyber risk remains a challenge for information security teams due to sparse incident data, rapidly evolving attacker behaviors, and the difficulty of integrating technical security controls with financial loss modeling. This talk presents a fully open, R-based implementation of a quantitative risk model that combines the Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) taxonomy with the MITRE ATT\&CK framework. The model leverages cmdstanr, Bayesian inference, and Monte Carlo simulation to estimate annualized loss exposure (ALE), incident frequency, and loss exceedance curves in a transparent and reproducible workflow.

The framework ingests MITRE ATT\&CK data, computes weighted defensive control strengths across relevant tactics, and builds Beta-distributed priors for per-stage attacker success probabilities. Frequency is modeled using a lognormal prior calibrated to expert-defined credible intervals. The model then performs posterior predictive simulation of attacker progression using tactic-level success probabilities, retry dynamics, fallback behavior, and stochastic detection effects, yielding scenario-specific estimates of successful incidents per year. Severity modeling follows FAIR principles, combining lognormal bodies with bounded Pareto tails to represent high-impact legal and reputational loss events.

All modeling components are implemented natively in R, including data preparation, Bayesian inference through cmdstanr, and visualization using ggplot2. The result is an end-to-end analytic workflow that unifies threat intelligence, control effectiveness, and financial loss modeling in a transparent, extensible, and reproducible structure suitable for cyber portfolio risk assessment.

This presentation will walk through the modeling design, R implementation, diagnostics, and practical applications, and will demonstrate how an ATT\&CK-aligned Bayesian FAIR model can support more rigorous, data-driven cyber-risk estimation.

## Defining Granular Risk Groups: A Reproducible Workflow for Multi-Threshold Survival Analysis

**Date & Time:** February 19 at 8:00am, Eastern

### Abstract

In risk modeling, categorising continuous variables—such as biomarker levels or credit scores—is essential for creating distinct risk groups. While existing R tools often optimise a single threshold (creating "High" vs "Low" groups), they lack a systematic framework for identifying multiple cut-points. This limitation forces analysts to rely on simple binary splits, often masking complex biological realities like U-shaped risk profiles.

In this lightning talk, I will introduce OptSurvCutR, an R package designed to bridge this gap. I will demonstrate how the package uses a reproducible workflow to systematically scan for optimal thresholds, allowing for the automatic detection of 3, 4, or 5+ distinct risk strata. We will also discuss how the package integrates Maximally Selected Rank Statistics (MSRS) and bootstrap validation to ensure these granular risk models are statistically robust and free from overfitting.

## Conformal Inference & Calibrating Uncertainty with a Three-Way Split

**Date & Time:** February 19 at 8:30am, Eastern

### Abstract

Conformal prediction methods allow us to create reliable prediction intervals for machine learning models. Machine learning models typically create a single point forecast, conformal prediction is a model agnostic method to add prediction intervals to any point forecast. This talk will introduce the three-way data split: one set for training the point forecast, one for interval calibration, and one for testing both. Using this approach, we can compute intervals for regression or classification models that provide valid coverage guarantees. The presentation will include a brief demo using open-source tools in R, illustrating how to implement the method and interpret the results. Attendees will leave with a straightforward workflow to assess prediction confidence in their own projects.

Lightning Talk Breakdown (10-minute speedrun!)

- Why Uncertainty Matters: Brief motivation for prediction intervals.
- What is Conformal Prediction: Simple overview and key concepts.
- Three-Way Split Method: How to split data for calibration and why it works.
- Example: Quick code walkthrough showing the method in practice.

## From Forecasts to Action: A Data Pipeline for Air Quality Monitoring and Notifications

**Date & Time:** February 19 at 9:15am, Eastern

### Abstract

Poor air quality has severe impacts on human health. While outdoor air quality is generally acceptable in Western countries, climate-related events such as wildfires and Saharan dust storms can lead to extreme pollution levels. To monitor air quality forecasts and inform individuals about dangerous exposure levels, I developed an automated data pipeline to monitor the risk. A scheduled daily GitHub Action renders a Quarto document and publishes it to Quarto Pub. The document retrieves regional forecast data from the WMO Barcelona Regional Center, obtains the local forecast for the city of Madrid, and sends email notifications (via the Sendgrid API) with recommendations and protective actions if pollution levels will be hazardous.

By providing automated email alerts, I aim to mitigate exposure to hazardous air quality. A complementary research project evaluates how people respond to these alerts during extreme pollution events and quantifies the share of outdoor pollution that infiltrates indoor spaces.

### Bio

Björn is an environmental and behavioral economist at the University of Hamburg. His research addresses critical societal issues by using state-of-the-art empirical methods and modern technology. His work is concerned with the evaluation of policies to improve air quality, public good contributions, common-pool resource problems, and distributional preferences.

## Mapping the Unknown During an Active Outbreak: Lessons from Geospatial Risk Modelling of Oropouche Virus

**Date & Time:** February 19 at 11:05am, Eastern

### Abstract

Since late 2023, Latin America has experienced an unprecedented increase in reported Oropouche virus (OROV) infections, with widespread transmission and previously uncommon morbidity and mortality, leading to its classification by the World Health Organization as a high regional public health risk.

In the context of limited epidemiological knowledge and heterogeneous surveillance, this talk focuses on the application of a geospatial modelling framework to support outbreak-time risk assessments. We integrated retrospective serological data from over 9,400 samples across six Latin American countries with presence-only incidence data from the outbreak, using MaxEnt models implemented in R to characterise spatial transmission risk.

Our analysis for example highlighted the role of climatic factors in shaping transmission risk and illustrates how retrospective serological data can inform spatial risk assessment when outbreak surveillance data are sparse.

More broadly, the talk discusses practical considerations for geospatial analysis during emerging infectious disease events, including data limitations, uncertainty, and time constraints.

With formal training in public health and epidemiology, including from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and the University of Cambridge, and field epidemiology experience across African and Latin American countries, working with organizations like Partners In Health and the World Health Organization, she develops reproducible analytical workflows that inform decision-making in data-sparse settings. Drawing on an interdisciplinary background spanning data science, clinical medicine, and global health, her approach is grounded in the conviction that modelling and digital tools should meaningfully inform both public health action and clinical decision-making in settings facing structural disadvantage.
