### About JD Long

JD Long is CTO at Palomar. He says “I’m the guy who can build a Monte Carlo model, help parallelize the model to run on cloud services and then stand in front of a group of business leaders and put the work in context where everyone understands. My super power is thinking probabilistically, understanding risk, and communicating clearly.”

JD is widely known in the R community for his practical focus on building real-world risk and insurance models and for helping large organizations adopt R and modern analytics practices. He is a frequent speaker at R conferences and meetups, and his work has been featured in the R Journal and other publications.

As co-author of _R Cookbook: Proven Recipes for Data Analysis, Statistics, and Graphics_, JD has helped thousands of R users solve everyday data and modeling problems. Through his talks and writing, he emphasizes probabilistic thinking, clear communication of uncertainty, and building analytics cultures that support experimentation and learning.
